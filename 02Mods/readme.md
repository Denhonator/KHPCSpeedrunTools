## Update status
All mods have been updated to work with the following versions:
- Epic Games: 1.0.0.9 (Global + JP)
- Steam: 1.0.0.1 (Global + JP)

This is not the current version of the game and thus will not work unless patched down or this is updated

## Note for Steam version
Unless the mods are updated for Steam version, you must get rid of the pak files with a `_0_P` at the end of the filename in the Content folder

## How to use:
- Copy SoftReset.pak to <your_install_directory>/KH_2.8/KINGDOM HEARTS 0.2 Birth by Sleep/Content/Paks

### SoftReset
- Press "]" key to open reset prompt and "Y" to confirm
