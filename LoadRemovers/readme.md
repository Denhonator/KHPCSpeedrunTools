## Update status
All load removers have been updated to work with Epic Games release 1.0.0.10 and Steam 1.0.0.2 aside from Melody of Memory

## How to use:
For all splitters aside from Melody of Memory these files are linked directly into LiveSplit and can be used as such.

### LiveSplit direct:
- Open the `Edit splits...` section of LiveSplit
- Select the game you wish to run
- Click the `Activate` button that should appear under the attempts section
- Click the now active `Settings` button next to what is now `Deactivate`
- Select the splits you wish to have
- Make sure you have 1 more split than the selected splits in settings (for the final split of the game which is always on), they can be named anything.
- Note: This should update every time the files here are changed

### Download:
- Download the file for the game you wish to run
- Add the `Scriptable Auto Splitter` component to your layout in LiveSplit
- In the newly added component browse to the downloaded .asl file
- Once selected you should get the settings populating
- Select the splits you wish to have
- Make sure you have 1 more split than the selected splits in settings (for the final split of the game which is always on), they can be named anything.
- Note: This will not automatically update when changes are made here, you will need to redownload the file
