## Update status
All load removers have been updated to work with Epic Games release 1.0.0.10 and Steam 1.0.0.2 aside from Melody of Memory

## How to use:
For all splitters aside from Melody of Memory these files are linked directly into LiveSplit and can be used as such. Choose one of the two bellow methods of install, DO NOT DO BOTH OR IT WILL SPLIT TWICE PER INSTANCE!

### LiveSplit direct:
- !!! Note: This should update every time the files here are changed !!!
- Open the `Edit splits...` section of LiveSplit
- Select the game you wish to run
- Click the `Activate` button that should appear under the attempts section
- ![image](../images/live_split_activate.png)
- Click the now active `Settings` button next to what is now `Deactivate`
- Select the splits you wish to have
- Make sure you have 1 more split than the selected splits in settings (for the final split of the game which is always on), they can be named anything.

### Download:
- !!! Note: This method will not automatically update when changes are made here, you will need to redownload the file !!!
- Download the file for the game you wish to run from this folder (eg. `KH1.asl`)
- Add the `Scriptable Auto Splitter` component to your layout in LiveSplit
- ![image](../images/live_split_layout.png)
- Double click the newly added component browse to the downloaded .asl file, it should end up looking something like this:
- ![image](../images/live_split_browse.png)
- Once selected you should get the settings populating
- Select the splits you wish to have
- Make sure you have 1 more split than the selected splits in settings (for the final split of the game which is always on), they can be named anything.
