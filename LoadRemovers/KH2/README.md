# KH2 Auto-splitter / Load remover
## How to use
1. Follow the instructions on the main README file
2. In the Scriptable Auto Splitter options, check the fights / splits you want the auto-splitter to split for you
3. The auto-splitter currently doesn't check if your current split matches what it's going to autosplit. So you need to have your splits ordered perfectly. 

Example: 

*Let's say you want to run roxas section, and need a few auto-splits for training, if your splits are:*

*Then, your auto-splitter should be configured this way*
