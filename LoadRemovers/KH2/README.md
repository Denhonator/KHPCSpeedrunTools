# KH2 Auto-splitter / Load remover

# A word of warning

Be carfeul. The auto-splitter is still in alpha, and currently has issues (such as splitting too early for some splits)

If you are going for a serious run for a top time, i'd advise you to deactivate the "split" and "start" options in the scriptable ASL, or simply to use Denho's build for the time being.
If you decide to use it anyway, have your Undo and skip split ready !

## How to use
1. Follow the instructions on the main README file
2. In the Scriptable Auto Splitter options, check the fights / splits you want the auto-splitter to split for you
3. The auto-splitter currently doesn't check if your current split matches what it's going to autosplit. So you need to have your splits ordered perfectly. 

Example: 

*Let's say you want to run roxas section, and need a few auto-splits for training, if your splits are:*

*Then, your auto-splitter should be configured this way*
