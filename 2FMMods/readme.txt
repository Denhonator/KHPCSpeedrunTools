How to use:
- Get LuaBackend https://github.com/Topaz-Reality/LuaBackend/releases/
- Place LuaBackend.exe into this folder and run it while 2FM is running
- Command line program should open, stating that it initialized script successfully.
- The scripts should adjust based on if JP or GLOBAL version is detected. I am not sure if languages other than English or Japanese will work, however.

SoftReset:
- In-game, press L1+L2+R1+R2+Start (or equivalent on your input device)
- Also resets RNG
- Sound effects may get muffled over time. This is a known bug in the game unrelated to this script. Hard reset when that happens.

NoGummi:
- As worlds get unlocked, you can enter them without having to do gummi missions

AutoAttack:
- Allows physically attacking continuously by holding attack button.
