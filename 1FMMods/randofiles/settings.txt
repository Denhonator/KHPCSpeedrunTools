c Prevent select key items from being randomized
c Item ID reference: https://pastebin.com/dfARF8ui
c Available options: D9, DF, BC, BD, BE, BF, C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, CD, E5
c D9 corresponds to a random slide, DF corresponds to a random evidence
c For example, if you want to unrandomize slide, evidence and entry pass:
c Unrandomize = D9 DF E5

Unrandomize =

c If you want guaranteed abilities on first level ups, put the hex codes for unequipped abilities here.
c Maximum 4 or they will replace other abilities.
c Find ability codes here https://pastebin.com/ZH0L3XXi
c Scroll down for the Not Equipped versions.
c For example, early scan and dodge roll would be:
c EarlyAbilities = 8A 96

EarlyAbilities = 8A

c Variable below determines how weapon stats will be randomized.
c 0 = Not at all
c 1 = Weak weapons buffed
c 2 = Stats shuffled between keyblades (str and magic only)
c 3 = Stats shuffled and weak stats buffed

WeaponStatRando = 3

c Stack abilities. Currently, you can sometimes get duplicate abilities.
c This will determine if having multiple equipped is beneficial
c 0 = No stacking. Vanilla. You just have excess abilities in the menu.
c 1 = High Jump stacks: Jump higher the more you have.
c 2 = High Jump, Glides, Mermaid Kick, Dodge Roll. First glide/superglide turns into glide, next into superglide and past that it gets faster.

StackAbilities = 2

c Allow warping with SaveAnywhere
c Warping at inopportune times can lead to crashes, audio bugs, softlocks or other issues with story progression
c Use at your own responsibility
c 0 = You can only warp from a save point
c 1 = You can warp in normal, non-combat state. Should circuvment most issues
c 2 = No restrictions

WarpAnywhere = 0

c Shop randomization
c 0 = Vanilla shops
c 1 = Shops can have anything but important key items
c 2 = Shops can have anything, including extra out of logic key items

RandomShops = 2

c Unrandomize rewards
c List the reward IDs from Rewards.txt that you want to unrandomize
c List them in VanillaRewards to keep it vanilla, or ReplaceRewards to put in a potion and keep the reward in the pool
c For example, if you want to unrandomize Sephiroth and Unknown
c ReplaceRewards = 95 97

VanillaRewards = 

ReplaceRewards = 

c Unrandomize chests
c List the chest IDs from Chests.txt that you want to unrandomize
c For example, if you want to unrandomize 100 acre wood chests
c ReplaceChests = a7 a8 a9 aa
c However note that if the chest contains a reward, you should unrandomize that reward as well, else whatever ends up on that reward will be inaccessible
c So you should also include 4c 9b 4d in ReplaceRewards

VanillaChests =

ReplaceChests =
