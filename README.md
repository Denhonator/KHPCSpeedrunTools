Get one of the following programs for running `lua` scripts:
- [LuaBackend](https://github.com/Sirius902/LuaBackend/releases) The `DBGHELP.zip` file.

Follow the instructions provided with each on setup or see the [LUA.md](LUA.md) file for more detailed instructions.

Note that using mods that affect a speedrun are not allowed unless specifically stated so, see specific game documents for further details.

### Load Removers

Add the `Scriptable Auto Splitter` component into your Livesplit layout, and select the .asl file for your game. Ensure you have a timer set to show game time. Some games do not support load removed time (LRT) leader boards, check your game's leader board to be sure. You may still use a load remover in these cases but you must ensure your recording includes the "real time" timing method for submission. For more detailed instructions and screenshots see [here](LoadRemovers/readme.md)!
