How to use:

Download files from the repository (ex. click the green Code button and download the repository as zip, or go to an individual file and click the download button in the top right)

## Mods
Follow this setup for any of the games aside from 0.2 and 3:

Get LuaBackend https://github.com/Sirius902/LuaBackend/releases or LuaFrontend https://github.com/TopazTK/LuaFrontend/releases. Follow the instructions provided there.

Note that using mods that affect a speedrun are not allowed unless specifically stated so. However, mods like SaveAnywhere or SoftReset can be utilized to reset runs faster. Unless activated, those mods do not affect the game.

If you have difficulties with setting these up please see the LUA.md file here for instructions.

## Load removers
Add scriptable auto splitter into your Livesplit layout, and select the .asl file for your game. Make sure you have a timer that shows game time. Some games do not support load removers, check your game and if it is not supported but you still want to make sure you have a timer that also shows real time for run validity.
