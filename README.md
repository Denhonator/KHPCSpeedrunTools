## 1FM and 2FM mods

Note that using mods that affect a speedrun are not allowed unless specifically stated so. However, mods like SaveAnywhere or SoftReset can be utilized to reset runs faster. Unless activated, those mods do not affect the game.

## Load removers
Add scriptable auto splitter into your Livesplit layout, and select the .asl file for your game. Make sure you have a timer that shows game time.
